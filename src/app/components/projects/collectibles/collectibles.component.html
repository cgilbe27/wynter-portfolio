        <p class="mbot10">
          Collectible and Games (CG) is a newly established small business that
          specializes in selling Yu-Gi-OH cards. They previously sold using a
          third-party marketplace site but with an increase of sales, the
          stakeholders wanted to create their own responsive, ecommerce site.
        </p>
        <p class="mbot10">
          Though CG specializes in Yu-Gi-OH, they have a five year plan where
          the goal is to expand product inventory outside of Yu-Gi-Oh. This
          beings said, they wanted a site that would be easily adaptable for
          future expansion.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mbot10">The problem:</h3>
        <p class="mbot10">
          CG is unable to control their product cost due to using a third-party
          marketplace site. Ultimately, negatively impacting revenue and
          business growth.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mbot10">The solution:</h3>
        <p class="mbot10">
          Create a responsive e-commerce site and begin establishing a brand
          identity.

        With a short project deadline, I should have appropriately allocated
