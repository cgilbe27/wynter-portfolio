        <p class="mbot10">
          Hello to the Ontrak design team! If you have yet to explore other
          pages of portfolio-let me re-introduce myself. My name is Wynter and I
          am a UX Designer who is specifically interested in working with your
          team.
        </p>
        <p class="mbot10">
          Why you might ask? I have a background in the healthcare sector and
          focused the application of my education toward behavior and mental
          health. This experience has had a huge impact on who I am and what I
          am passionate about. Though bedside care was fulfilling, I pivoted
          into UX with a goal to have a have wider impact while being
          “behind-the-scenes”. My hopes is to use my UX skillset to support
          businesses and participate in product creation to positively impact
          those in need of support and treatment.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mbot10">The problem:</h3>
        <p class="mbot10">
          Currently, your company has an open position for the role of “UX
          Design Intern” which is unfulfilled.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mbot10">The solution:</h3>
        <p class="mbot10">
          Create a company specific page with reasons and examples on why I
          would be good candidate to consider for the position. Hopefully, this
          will lead to fulfilling the position and solving “the problem”.

        A few reasons why I am interested in being a part of the Ontrak team.
      </p>

    <div class="w100 mw1064" fxLayout="column">
      <h3 class="mbot10">Reason one</h3>
      <p class="mbot10">
        While doing research on Ontrak, I learned that the approach used leads
        to <span class="sky-blue-c fwb">65% reduction in hospitization</span>. I
        worked as a behavior health technician at a sizable, city hosptial. The
        fact that I have potential of working for a company that aids in the
        reduction of hospitalization is amazing. Proactive, preventative care is
        better than reactive care.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mbot10">Reason two</h3>
      <p class="mbot10">
        Proof is in the pudding. Previous research has shown that 50% of clients
        stop going to therapy after their 3rd session. Ontrak has an
        <span class="sky-blue-c fwb">80% retention rate</span> which is
        metaphorically and literally HUGE.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mbot10">Reason three</h3>
      <p class="mbot10">
        From what I understand,
        <span class="sky-blue-c fwb"
          >Ontrak takes a personalized approach to care</span
        >. Addressing the whole health of a member and the barriers is
        essiential to effective care which Ontrak has proven to be true (see
        reason one and two). When I worked in the hospital system, I felt like
        that was lacking. I saw time and time again where patients’ conditions
        were treated and not the patient themselves. I find it inspiring and
        admirable that Ontrak mission is to deliver a unique healthcare
        experience that is evidence based and person-focused.

        Not only did I apply for the position and send my resume BUT
        <span class="sky-blue-c fwb">I also created this page</span>. That is

          >I have the education and skillset that is specified within the job

        My skillset includes visual UI design, sketching, wireframing,
        interactive design, prototyping and responsive design. I also have a
        portfolio (obviously!) that showcases these skills.

          >Watchlist case study</span

          >Kaus case study</span

        design for an insurance company. Through research, I focused on a
        feature that would make consuming insurance jargon easier for the user
        and created a brand that was approachable and friendly.

          >I have worked in the healthcare field-specifically in the
          mental/behavior health sector</span

        limb and say that I may be one of a few, if not the only applicant, that
        has this kind of experience. This will lead me to better understanding
        and empathizing with the end-users (the members) and the product itself.
        I am genuinely passionate about this sector and the under-served
        population. This role would honestly be the perfect blend of my two
        worlds; healthcare and UX.
