          Kaus has been in the insurance business for 30 years and provides all
          types of insurance for individuals. They currently work in a B2B
          environment through regional agents to sell their products.
        </p>
        <p class="mbot10">
          Kaus wants to move from a B2B environment to a B2C environment. They
          want to pivot to the digital space, refresh their brand, and tap into
          the younger market.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mbot10">The problem:</h3>
        <p class="mbot10">
          Kaus currently lacks an e-commerce site where they can sell in a B2C
          environment.

        <h3 class="mbot10">The solution:</h3>
        <p class="mbot10">
          Design a responsive, e-commerce insurance site that is approachable to
          a younger demongraphic. Refresh the overall brand.
